        "about_me": "Hi, I'm Corina, a passionate Illustrator with over five years of experience bringing stories to life through vibrant visuals. My journey began in traditional art, but I soon discovered a love for digital Illustration and character design. I'm inspired by nature, fashion, and everyday moments, which I often translate into whimsical compositions. Over the years, I've worked with both startups and established brands to create impactful Illustrations for campaigns, packaging, and editorial pieces. My creative process is deeply collaborative. I believe every client's story is unique and deserves a tailored visual language. I'm always excited to explore bold colors and playful styles, while maintaining clear communication throughout every project. I'm committed to delivering work that's not only beautiful but meaningful and strategic. Let's make something magical together!",
